//! Global download state manager (the "DownloadCenter").
//!
//! One process-wide registry that owns the lifecycle of *every* artifact Ryu
//! pulls over the network — chat/embedding GGUFs, engine binaries (llama.cpp,
//! whisper, sd-server), agent binaries, the parakeet bundle, skills, and so on.
//! Each download is a [`DownloadTask`] moving through a small state machine
//! (queued → active → paused → completed/failed/cancelled). Progress, pause,
//! resume, and cancel are first-class.
//!
//! Why this exists: before this module every downloader streamed the whole file
//! into a `Vec<u8>` (multi-GB into RAM) with no progress, cancel, or resume, and
//! coarse install state lived in a separate polling store. The center replaces
//! the RAM path with stream-to-disk `.part` files (HTTP Range + `If-Range`
//! resume), exposes live progress over a broadcast channel (SSE), and is the
//! single source of truth that `/api/setup/status` is derived from.
//!
//! Placement (Core vs Gateway): downloading artifacts is "what runs" → Core.
//!
//! ## Kernel seam ([`DownloadsHost`])
//!
//! This is an extracted Core capability crate with ZERO dependency on
//! `apps/core`. The three cross-cutting couplings the transfer engine needs —
//! all of which are process-global state in Core — invert through the narrow
//! [`DownloadsHost`] trait:
//!
//! - the active `~/.ryu` **data dir** (`downloads.json` + `downloads-history.json`
//!   live under it; it is dynamic — user data-folder relocation moves it),
//! - the **version-store checksum-skip** (a completed re-download is skipped when
//!   the on-disk file already matches the recorded checksum), and
//! - **Hugging Face bearer auth** (attach the user's HF token only to Hub hosts).
//!
//! Core implements it once (`apps/core/src/downloads/mod.rs` `CoreDownloadsHost`)
//! and installs it at boot via [`set_global_host`], BEFORE the first download can
//! run. Production [`host`] is strict: it panics loudly if the host was never
//! installed rather than silently defaulting to a wrong data dir / dropping HF
//! auth. The crate's own tests install a temp-dir [`DownloadsHost`] first.
